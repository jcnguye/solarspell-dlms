## Troubleshooting

#### psycopg2
For errors encountered installing psycopg2: link[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5420789/how-to-install-psycopg2-with-pip-on-python] 

#### Pillow
For errors encountered installing Pillow: link[https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html]
It seems like the version of Pillow listed in the requirements.txt is too old for the latest releases of python, so it will need to be updated.
Pillow might also be completely unused? This needs to be tested though.

djangorestframework needs to be updated?
