# SolarSPELL-DLMS

This is the latest repository for the DLMS, which is one tool used to create the software loaded on a SolarSPELL. More information about SolarSPELL can be found [here](http://solarspell.org/).

## Installation

Before installation of the DLMS, make sure that Python 3.8+ and Node >= 10, <= 16 are installed.

### Python Dependencies

Create a python venv 
To install python dependencies, run this command in the base directory.
#### psycopg2
Install psycopg2
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

#### Pillow
For errors encountered installing Pillow: link[https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html]
It seems like the version of Pillow listed in the requirements.txt is too old for the latest releases of python, so it will need to be updated.
Pillow might also be completely unused? This needs to be tested though.

djangorestframework needs to be updated?
Install pillow 
```bash
python -m pip install Pillow 
```

#### After pillow and psycopg2
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database

Create a PostgreSQL user and database.
```
sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive
sudo -u postgres createdb dlms
sudo -u postgres psql
ALTER USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password'
```

### Env File

Duplicate `env.example` from the /dlms directory, change the appropriate values, and rename it `.env`. This step must be done before the following steps will work.

Inside env file specify 
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database
### Python virutal envirorment 

Before running python commands make a virutal envirorment folder to run your server, have python installed
```bash
python -m venv <EnvirormentName>
```

Activate to enter in envirorment
Navigate to venv\Scripts
```bash
python acitvate
```
Should look like this when activated 
(venv) D:\SollarSpell\solarspell-dlms\venv\Scripts>
